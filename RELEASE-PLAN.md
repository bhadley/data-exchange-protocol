# Background and Context

Releases of the Pathfinder Framework (Version 2 can be found [here](https://www.carbon-transparency.com/media/jpslsujn/pathfinder-framework.pdf)) are strongly
informing the tech specs releases.

Therefore, this timeline page contains the release plan for both, the Pathfinder Framework and the Pathfinder Tech Specs.

In addition, the tables below disclose deprecation of releases and subsequent sunset dates.
